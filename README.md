This project aims to explore the implementation of Machine Learning Models with regularization, optimization, and Error analysis techniques used in machine learning to improve models' performance, convergence speed, and efficiency for the predicction of heart diseases.
Some of the concepts to be covered here are:

Data Exploration
Data cleaning, handling, and preprocessing
Standarization
Spliting
vanilla Model
Error analysis on Vanilla Model
Evaluation of vanilla model
Optimized model(with atleast 3 optimization techniques)
Error Analysis on Optimized Model
Evaluation of optimized Model
Summarry and discussions of results

Comparison of Performance:
Accuracy:

The optimized model achieved an accuracy of 83.61%, while the vanilla model reached 80.33%. The optimized model outperformed the vanilla model by a margin of about 3.3%.
Loss:

The optimized model had a lower test loss (0.4006) compared to the vanilla model's test loss (0.4605), indicating better calibration of the optimized model's predictions.
Confusion Matrix:

Both models had the same number of false positives (4). However, the optimized model had fewer false negatives (6 vs. 8), which means it did a better job identifying patients with heart disease.
Classification Report:

The precision and recall for both classes improved slightly with the optimized model:
Heart Disease Present:
Precision improved from 0.76 to 0.81.
Recall remained the same at 0.86.
Heart Disease Absent:
Precision improved from 0.86 to 0.87.
Recall improved from 0.75 to 0.81.
The F1-scores and macro/weighted averages show the optimized model provided better balanced performance across both classes, with the macro and weighted averages improving from 0.80 to 0.84.
Interpretation:
Vanilla Model:

The vanilla model shows decent performance with an accuracy of 80.33%. However, it struggled slightly with identifying heart disease absence (lower recall), meaning it missed a few cases where heart disease wasn't present.
Optimized Model:

The optimized model, with the addition of dropout, more hidden layers, and the Adam optimizer, outperformed the vanilla model. It showed higher precision and recall in predicting both heart disease presence and absence, leading to improved overall accuracy and better generalization on the test set.
The lower test loss indicates that the optimized model produces better-calibrated predictions, and its higher F1-scores demonstrate a more balanced classification performance between positive and negative classes.
Conclusion:
The optimized model performed better across all key metrics—accuracy, loss, precision, recall, and F1-score—compared to the vanilla model. This suggests that the improvements (dropout layers, Adam optimizer, and deeper architecture) successfully enhanced the model's ability to generalize and accurately detect heart disease.
